# React to-do app

A small React App made for learning purpose

## How to use it

To test this app, you can simply clone it and open the `index.html` file
in your favorite browser.

**Make sure to have Javascript enabled in your browser to run the application
properly.**

## Setup

In case you want to play with this code, run the following command line
so the application refreshes itself whenever a new change is applied.

```shell
npx babel --watch src --out-dir . --presets react-app/prod
```

## Note

The application does not hold the list state once the page is refreshed.
